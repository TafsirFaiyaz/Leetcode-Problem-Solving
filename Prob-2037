#2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone

# If we sort both seats and students then for i'th position we can get the minimum amount of moves

class Solution:
    def minMovesToSeat(self, seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
        seats.sort()
        students.sort()
        moves = 0

        for i in range(len(seats)):
            moves += (abs(seats[i] - students[i]))        # Taking absolute value because (seats[i] - students[i]) can be negative too

        return moves
